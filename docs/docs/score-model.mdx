# Score Model

Score model is the heart of the library. Rendered score uses model as the primary source. It's structure is very similar to how data is stored in MNX format.
The model can be accessed as follows

```js
const score = scoreStorm.getScore()
```

It's worth mentioning that the model is kind of read-only. It can be modified only by executing commands.

```js
scoreStorm.execute(new AddMeasureCommand())
scoreStorm.execute(new RemoveMeasureCommand(index))
```

Model is visualized in the following diagram:

import ClassDiagram from "@site/src/components/ClassDiagram"

<ClassDiagram />
