# Score Model

Score model is the heart of the library. Rendered score uses model as primary source, as well as changing the rendered score is only possible by altering the model

The model is very similar to how data is stored in MNX format.
The model can be accessed as follows

```js
const score = scoreStorm.getScore()
```

Model provides a set of public methods:

```js
score.addMeasure()
score.removeMeasure(index)
```

Unlike main model, graphical model represents how the score is rendered on the screen. It is a tree structure that contains all the graphical elements of the score.

Relationship between the main model and graphical model are visualized in the following diagram:

import ClassDiagram from "@site/src/components/ClassDiagram"

<ClassDiagram />
