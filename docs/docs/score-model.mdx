# Score Model

Score model is the heart of the library. Rendered score uses model as primary source, as well as changing the rendered score is only possible by altering the model

The model is very similar to how data is stored in MNX format.
The model can be accessed as follows

```js
const score = scoreStorm.getScore()
```

Model provides a set of public methods:

```js
score.addMeasure()
score.removeMeasure(index)
```
