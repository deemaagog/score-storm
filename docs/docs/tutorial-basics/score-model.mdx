# Score model

At the very center of the core is a Score model. The model is very similar to how data is stored in MNX format.

The model can be accessed as follows

```js
const score = scoreStorm.getScore()
```

Model provides a set of public methods:

```js
score.addMeasure();
score.removeMeasure(index),
```
