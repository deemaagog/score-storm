# Installation

Library consists of several packages. You'll need core package and one of the renderers at a minimum

```bash
npm i @score-storm/core
npm i @score-storm/svg-renderer
```

or

```bash
yarn add @score-storm/core
yarn add @score-storm/svg-renderer
```

Now you can start building stuff:

```js
import ScoreStorm from "@score-storm/core"
const scoreStorm = new ScoreStorm()

// use the full power of the library
```
