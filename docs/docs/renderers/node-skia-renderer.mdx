# Node Skia Renderer

While it's possible to use web renderers such as canvas-renderer in Node.js using JS-DOM
or similar techniques, Score Storm offers a dedicated renderer optimized for the Node.js environment. It's powered by the amazing, high-performance SKIA graphics library.

It leverages [@napi-rs/canvas](https://github.com/Brooooooklyn/canvas) under the hood. Read more on it's requirements [here](https://github.com/Brooooooklyn/canvas?tab=readme-ov-file#system-requirement).

It can be used in Node.js code as follows:

```ts
import ScoreStorm, { Score } from "@score-storm/core"
import NodeSkiaRenderer, { GlobalFonts } from "@score-storm/node-skia-renderer"
import { writeFileSync } from "fs"
import { join } from "path"

// Register font
GlobalFonts.registerFromPath(join(__dirname, "..", "fonts", "Bravura.woff2"), "Bravura")

// Create a new instance of ScoreStorm
const scoreStorm = new ScoreStorm()

// Create a dead simple score with 2 measures of 4/4
const score = Score.createQuickScore({ numberOfMeasures: 2, timeSignature: { count: 4, unit: 4 } })
ss.setScore(score)

// Create a new instance of NodeSkiaRenderer with a width of 600
const renderer = new NodeSkiaRenderer(600)
ss.setRenderer(renderer)

// finally render the score
ss.render()

// get the buffer and save it to a file
const buffer = renderer.canvas.toBuffer("image/png")
writeFileSync(join(__dirname, "score-storm-test.png"), buffer)
```
